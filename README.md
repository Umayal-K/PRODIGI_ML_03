This repository contains code on support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dog.
## Techniques:
The following techniques are implemented in this project:
- support vector machine (SVM)

For classification and regression applications, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an effective supervised machine learning technique.Finding the ideal hyperplane with the largest margin between data points of different classes is its main goal. In order to do this,SVM converts the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space and finds the hyperplane that best divides the classes inside it.With the application of kernel functions, it can handle data that is both linearly and non-linearly separable, and it is especially efficient in high-dimensional spaces.Due to their stability and adaptability,SVMs are widely employed in many different areas, including bioinformatics, text classification, and picture classification.
